    Problem 1
 
Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.
Example:
Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )
Give a solutions to this problem, using arrays


Solution:

1. Declare a variable to hold each arrays e.g 
    num1:= [3, 1, 7, 9]
    num2:= [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]

2. Declare a variable to hold all distinct elements that are prsent in either array..
    sameNum:= [3, 1, 9]

3. Sum the distint element present in either arrays
4. Print the result
